# FAQ

## Is there a client class?

- The SDK exposes a global client with simple functions (`emit`, `record`, `configure`, …). No separate class is required.

## Does the SDK validate fields?

- Yes. `metric` must be non‑empty; token fields must be non‑negative integers. Unknown fields are omitted.

## How do I add a default end‑user label?

- Call `nivara.set_user("end_user_42")`. Omit `user_identifier` in later calls.

## Can I send metrics synchronously?

- Use `nivara.record(...)`.

## Will it retry automatically?

- Enable with `configure(retries>0)`. Applies to 408, 429, and 5xx.

## What’s the default base URL?

- `https://api.getnivara.com`. You can override via `NIVARA_BASE_URL` or `configure(base_url=...)`.

## Is there an OpenAI helper?

- Yes: `nivara.from_openai(resp)` extracts usage fields for `emit/record`.
